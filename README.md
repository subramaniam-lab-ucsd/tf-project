# tf-project
Transcription Factor Project

**Goal:** Analyze the hiPSC CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset from the Mali Lab at UCSD (Nourreddine et al 2023 preprint) to investigate the effects of transcription factor knockdowns (TF KDs)

**Guiding Questions:** What do TF KD effects reveal about:
* … the transcription regulatory network of hiPSCs, and TF crosstalk?
* … cell lineage?
* … how TFs influence chromatin remodeling?
